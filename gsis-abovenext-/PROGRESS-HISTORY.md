# PROGRESS-HISTORY.md — GSIS Website & Admin Portal (full build log)

> ⚠️ **PRIVATE FILE** — lives in the private code repo only, NOT the public progress repo. May reference internal detail but still **never** commit real secrets or credentials.

> **Append-only.** The agent appends the FULL detailed entry for each finished build-step here (AGENT.md §6), before `[CHECKPOINT]`. PROGRESS.md stays lean and points here for detail. The agent does NOT read this file cover-to-cover — only to recover detail about an older step.

## 01 — foundation-nextjs — DONE (2026-07-17)

**Branch:** feature/01-foundation-nextjs (WORK TYPE: FEATURE)

Stood up the deployable Next.js 15 skeleton per specs/01-foundation-nextjs.md.

**Files added**
- package.json (pnpm, Next 15 / React 19 / TS strict / Tailwind 3.4 / ESLint 8 + Prettier / Prisma 6), pnpm-lock.yaml.
- tsconfig.json (strict, @/* path alias), next.config.ts (reactStrictMode, poweredByHeader off).
- tailwind.config.ts, postcss.config.mjs, app/globals.css (tailwind layers).
- .eslintrc.json (next/core-web-vitals + next/typescript + prettier), .prettierrc.json (+ tailwind plugin).
- app/layout.tsx (robots meta fail-closed on isIndexable), app/page.tsx (env-aware placeholder), app/robots.ts (fail-closed Disallow when not production).
- app/api/health/route.ts — GET /api/health → { status:"ok", env, time }, force-dynamic.
- lib/env.ts — central APP_ENV; production ONLY when APP_ENV==="production", else fail-closed to staging/noindex (isProduction/isStaging/isIndexable helpers).
- lib/db.ts — singleton PrismaClient cached on globalThis (HMR-safe).
- prisma/schema.prisma — datasource(postgresql) + generator only; models arrive in step 04.
- .env.example — DATABASE_URL, APP_ENV, JWT_SECRET, SCREENSHOT_TOKEN (placeholders only).
- deploy.sh (+x) — per ARCHITECTURE §12: dangerous-command fence (rejects main/production/prod + destructive args), node detection (nvm→aaPanel→system), corepack-pnpm activation, git fetch/reset (never clone, never main), pnpm install --frozen-lockfile, prisma generate then migrate deploy, fresh BUILD_ID, pnpm build, pm2 restart (not reload) via ecosystem.config.js, graceful /api/health poll.
- ecosystem.config.js — pm2 fork process "gsis-web" (next start).
- .github/workflows/ci.yml — pnpm install → prisma generate → typecheck → lint → build (APP_ENV=staging).
- .gitignore.

**Decisions**
- Toolchain: standardised on pnpm per CLAUDE.md (which invokes pnpm for generate/lint/typecheck). §12 point 3 literally names `npm ci --include=dev`; to keep ONE consistent lockfile/toolchain across local, CI, and deploy, deploy.sh activates pnpm via corepack (bundled with Node) and runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, which still fulfils §12's substance (install WITH dev deps; prisma generate after install, before build). Committing both npm+pnpm lockfiles was rejected as drift-prone; npm ci without package-lock.json cannot work alongside pnpm-lock.yaml.
- Tailwind v3.4 (not v4) for stability ahead of the step-02 design system.
- Added app/robots.ts in addition to the noindex meta so the fail-closed noindex is enforced at the crawler level too; richer production robots+sitemap deferred to the SEO step.

**Gates:** pnpm prisma generate ✔ · pnpm typecheck ✔ (clean) · pnpm lint ✔ (no warnings/errors). build/tests left to controller per CLAUDE.md (must not run build/test locally). env fail-closed verified by inspection of lib/env.ts.

## 02 — design-system — DONE (2026-07-17)

**Work type:** FEATURE (branch feature/02-design-system)

**Goal:** Implement the finalised GSIS design system (ARCHITECTURE §8) as reusable Tailwind tokens + shared UI components, fonts, swappable public asset structure, and animation utilities.

**What changed:**
- `tailwind.config.ts`: full palette by literal name (navy #0F2A47, navy-deep #0A1E33, teal #0E8A7A, teal-bright #14A594, amber #F5A623, off-white #F7F9FB, paper #FFFFFF, slate #2B3A4A, slate-soft #5B6B7B, line #E4EAEF) + semantic CSS-var tokens (background/surface/foreground/muted/border) for light/dark. Container capped 1320px, `rounded-card` 18px, `rounded-pill`, soft layered shadow scale (soft-sm/soft/soft-lg/soft-xl/header), keyframes+animations (fade-in, fade-up, slide-in-right, shine). darkMode:'class'.
- `app/globals.css`: light + `.dark` (navy-deep surfaces) semantic token vars as RGB channels; base body/heading fonts; prefers-reduced-motion guard.
- `app/layout.tsx`: Fraunces (display) + Inter (body) via next/font, exposed as CSS vars on <html>.
- Components in `components/ui/` (+ barrel index): Button (pill, tactile lift+shadow+shine+arrow-nudge, next/link for internal href), Card (18px radius/soft shadow), Container (1320px), SectionHeading, Header (client; floating, sticky-on-scroll shadow lift, translucent blur, amber hover-underline nav, logo-only, amber Apply CTA, mobile slide-in menu with scroll-lock), Footer (floating dark navy, AboveNext credit → abovenext.com), Tabs (client), Carousel/Slider (client), AnimatedCounter (client; IO count-up, reduced-motion aware), Reveal (client; scroll-reveal), WhatsAppButton (floating wa.me), ClayIcon (renders /assets PNG), Skeleton, ThemeToggle (demo dark toggle).
- Animation utils: `lib/hooks/useInView.ts` (IntersectionObserver, reduced-motion + SSR fallback to visible). `lib/cn.ts` dependency-free classname joiner.
- Assets: generated `public/assets/` placeholders with stable filenames — logo.png, val-1..5/why-1..4/prog-1..5 clay PNGs, why.jpg, hero.jpg, about-1/2.jpg, avatar-1..4.jpg (photos clearly marked "PLACEHOLDER — SWAP FILE"). `public/assets/README.md` documents swap contract.
- Demo route `app/dev/ui/page.tsx`: Storybook-style showcase of every component/token; noindex metadata + notFound() in production (staging-only, unlinked).
- Tests: added Vitest + jsdom + Testing Library harness (`vitest.config.ts`, `vitest.setup.ts`, next/image + next/link test stubs). `components/ui/__tests__/components.test.tsx` — 16 render/behaviour tests. `test:unit` now runs `vitest run`.

**Decisions:**
- Dependency-free `cn` (no clsx/tailwind-merge) to keep the kit lean.
- Semantic tokens via CSS vars so dark mode is a single `.dark` class swap.
- Button routes internal hrefs through next/link, external/protocol links stay <a> (avoids no-html-link-for-pages).
- Real photos not available → all assets are labelled placeholders with stable names; swapping a file needs no code change.

**Gates:** typecheck ✔ · lint ✔ (0 warnings/errors) · test:unit 16/16 (1 suite; +16) ✔ · build ➖ (controller runs) · responsive ✔ (md breakpoints, mobile menu) · design ✔ (palette/type/radius per §8) · SEO ➖ · audit ➖ · privacy ➖ · env ✔.

**Notes:** next/font fetches Fraunces/Inter at build (network needed). /dev/ui must stay unlinked + noindex.
